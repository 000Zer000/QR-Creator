1.0.0:
    First release

1.1.0:
    Improvements:
        Now not being able to read the file results into falling back to reading from STDIN
        A bug which resulted into duplicate data is fixed
        That unexpected print of `True` to the console is removed
        Default output name is now out.png instead of Output.png
        Also lack of a colon in message of reading from STDIN is not fixed

    What got removed:
        Nothing
    
    Additions:
        Now you can run `pip install .` and call this program from whatever place you want
        (I mean you should do that, Unless you want to install the dependencies manually 
        and calling the script also manually)
